# Project Context and Scope

This project will be used by GE Aviation's Cyber Intelligence team to provide a priority to their research of open-source intelligence(OSINT) reports. As a global company doing high-value work, the volume of relevant reports published daily is too much for even a large team of analysts to read and understand quickly. Our tool would help give priority to what reports need to be read first and what can be overlooked, making sure each piece of vital information gets the attention it needs.

# High-level Requirements

- A natural language processor/content analyser to analyze the contents of threat reports and pick out key terms and themes
- Similarity analyzer to compare the output of the content to a user
- Significance/relevance score calculator that generates a numerical representation of the output of the similarity analyzer to indicate how relevant a report is to the user-defined list of topics.

# Technology

Specify the development approach of your team, including programming languages, database, development, testing, and deployment environments.

You also need to mention if there are any technical support and preferences from the company and if they provide an existing version of the application.

# Project Management

We will follow the Scrum approach, thus your team needs to identify the task in each sprint cycles, team meeting schedules, including this Fall and next Spring semester. The planned schedule and sprint cycles for Spring 2021 are as follows.

In this section, provide the link to your team bitbucket repository and Trello board. Your team must share the repo and the board with cps490f20@gmail.com

Include the screenshot of the timeline from your Trello board (with tasks). You can use the Trello template available here (only with timeline): [https://trello.com/b/uIgKfjr6/cps491-s21](https://trello.com/b/uIgKfjr6/cps491-s21)  

Below is the example of the Trello board timeline (Gantt chart) with sprint cycles but without tasks for Spring 2021:
