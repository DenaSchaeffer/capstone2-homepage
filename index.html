		<h1>Project Context and Scope</h1>
			<p>
				This project will be used by GE Aviation's Cyber Intelligence team to provide a priority to their research of open-source intelligence (OSINT) reports.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a global company doing high-value work, the volume of relevant reports published daily is too much for even a large team of analysts to read and understand quickly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our tool would help give priority to what reports need to be read first and what can be overlooked, making sure each piece of vital information gets the attention it needs to continuously give GE's Threat Hunting team a grasp on the cyber space that faces them.
